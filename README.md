# DCGAN_CelebA
This repository contains the implementation of a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) designed to generate realistic images. The model has been trained on the CelebA dataset, a large-scale collection of celebrity faces, to learn the complex features and patterns present in human faces. By leveraging the power of DCGAN, the project demonstrates the ability to generate new, high-quality images that resemble the characteristics of the original dataset. The repository includes the code for training the model, as well as examples of generated images at different epochs during the training process.

You can view the generated images at different epochs in this [PDF file](DCGAN_outputs.pdf).
